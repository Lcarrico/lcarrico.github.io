<h3>
Lesson 1.2 - Add Global Configuration Files!
</h3>

	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
	
Short excersises 

	(Hint: try the previous command without your name or email included)
	Check to see if your name and email were properly configured.
	
</pre>

<h3>
Lesson 2 - Initialize Git!
</h3>

<pre>
Create a Project folder in your computer.

Add an empty text document to that folder. It can be named anything you want. //Make sure you do this

Open either CMD, Powershell, or Git Bash within your project folder. 
	If you're using CMD or Powershell make sure you understand the following commands:
		dir //Lists of folders in your current space
		cd "folder name" //Moves you to that folder
		cd .. //moves you up a folder
	

In your terminal of choice, initialize git in the project folder you're in.

Use the command:
	git init
	
<pre>
	
	
<h3>
Lesson 3 - Add your files to your git repository!
</h3>

<pre>
Run the command:
	git status
	
You should see that the file that we have created in our project folder is considered "untracked". 
This means that git is not current keeping track or updates on that file. 
If we want to track the file we would have to run the git add command.

Run the command:
	git add "InsertFilenameHere.txt"
	
	This adds the specific file to the git repository

The other command you can run is:
	git add "*"
	
	This adds all current untracked files to be tracked by git.
	
Run the command:
	git status
	
It should tell you that changes are ready to be committed. 
This means that the file has been added to the repository,
but the current changes to the file has not yet been made.

Run the command 
	git commit -m "Init Commit"
	
The git commit saves or updates the current file to the repository. 
The -m "Init Commit" save the "Init Commit" as a message to go with the update.
</pre>

<h3>
Lesson 4 - Create a new github repository
</h3>

<pre>
Go to your github account.

Select new Repository and name it whatever you want.

Got back to your terminal and then add the remote repository with:

git remote add origin place-repository-URL-here

In order to verify the repository we run:
git remote -v

Finally we run:
git push origin master

That pushes the repository you have in your computer to github.

Exercise: 
Try making changes to your text file and then push those changes to github!
</pre>

<h3>
Lesson 5 - Clone a repository
</h3>

<pre>
Go to the github page of the repository you want to close.

Here's a good one: <a href="https://github.com/Lcarrico/MergeSort"> https://github.com/Lcarrico/MergeSort </a>

Click the clone or download button and copy the HTTP of the repository.

Go back to your terminal set your current directory
	to where ever you'd like to save the repository

Then run the command:
git clone insert-the-http-you-got-here

Now go ahead and use your file explorer to explore your new repo.
</pre>

<h3>
Lesson 6 - Github Pages
</h3>

<pre>
Github has this thing where it lets you host a page with it.

So...... Let's make one.

Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, 
where username is your username on GitHub.
example: lcarrico.github.io

Go ahead and clone the new repository you just made

cd into your new repositroy

Create the index.html file inside the that you will be using.

Here's an example:
<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt; Welcome to my site! &lt;/h1&gt;
	
		&lt;h3&gt; By Leo Carrico &lt;/h3&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt; I'm just a regular boy living life and doing regular things. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

Add and commit this file to the repository and then push it to github with the command:
git push

Now open your web browser and check out the site that you made! 
(note: site should url should look like "https://username.github.io.")


Go ahead and try to improve your site a bit.
